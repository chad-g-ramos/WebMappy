        <h3>High Plains</h3>
        The High Plains of Texas are located at the panhandle; this ecoregion is interesting as it expands from Texas to throughout the Midwest. The high plains consist of dry flat lands that tend to house vegetation and wildlife suitable for the environment. Vegetation includes the short-grass prairie, the juniper shrub, cottonwood, and a bit of agriculture. The wildlife includes the Bison, Prairie dogs, rattlesnakes, and the Palo Duro Mouse. The reason for the restricted plants and wildlife is due to the alkaline soils that limit the growth of trees and vegetation. The High Plains main landmark is the Palo Duro Canyon State Park which is the 2nd largest canyon in America and offers spectacular views that stretch for miles.  The petroleum industry of Texas is placed within this ecoregion, and it is flat, has few disturbances, and has abundant amounts of oil.

# The Future of San Marcos
San Marcos is an ever growing city. In fact it is the 4th fastest growing college city in the US! With how fast San Marcos is growing the bike paths/walkways are going to be filled up more and more. Our project idea aims at portraying the future bike/walk paths that have been planned by the city of San Marcos. When entering the webpage, you will be greeted with a map showcasing all future paths and current paths. Since San Marcos is a relatively small city, biking and walking is more relevant than ever. Considering how bad traffic will get from increased population this web page will make it easier to understand how our city will function.

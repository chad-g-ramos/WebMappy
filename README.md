# Introduction

Texas is a bridge when it comes to geographic diversity. From the southern subtropical to the northern temperate areas, Texas is comprised of a range of ecoregions, each with its own characteristics. Due to its grand size, Texas can be divded into 12 ecoregions: The Piney Woods, the Gulf Prairies and marshes, the Post Oak Savanah, the Blackland Prairies, the Cross Timbers, the South Texas Plains, the Edwards Plateau, the Rolling Plains, the High Plains, the Trans-Pecos, the Arizona/New Mexico Mountains, and the Chihuahuan Deserts. Each of these ecoregions contribute greatly to the gographical diversity of Texas and contains information that can be easily accessed within this project. 

## About The Project

The project was created to bring a public understanding of Texas ecoregions. This interactive application was designed in a user-focused perspective, so any user can ultize the Texas ecoregions infomration. This project serves as as an education tool that offers accessible information for the layman, the experinced scientists, and everyone in between. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive application that allows users to become more knowledgeable about Texas ecoregion at any level of complexity. 

## The Features & Design
**The Features**

-**User-Focused Interface**: The entire project is based on the accessibility of retrieving the information and interacting with the maps easily.

-**Mobile-Friendly**: The project is created so that the website can be accessible in any form of viewing. 

**The Design**

The user has the possibility to control the visualization output from a simple click. The aim is for users to find specific information within three clicks on the website. As stated, the website provides level of complexity for the ecoregions, which allows any user to utilize the information.
